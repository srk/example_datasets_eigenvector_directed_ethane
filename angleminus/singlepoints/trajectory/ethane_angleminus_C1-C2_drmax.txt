trajplot
========
Usage: trajplot <file containing list of files in desired sequence>
Input file format: each line has the format
              datafilename linecolour linestyle markersymbol markerfill markersize filterstring
              e.g. data.txt red - o full 5 avg+avg+avg
              Blank lines or lines starting with # are ignored. filterstring = 'none' or sequences of filter operations e.g. 'avg','turn'
              If a header line of the form '# curvelabelstring' is found in the input data header, it is used to set the curve label
