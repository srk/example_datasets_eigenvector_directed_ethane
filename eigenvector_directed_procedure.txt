Procedure to generate a sequence of molecular graphs: eigenvector-directed case
===============================================================================
This example uses the Gaussian (G09) electronic structure code, some QuantVec programs and the QTAIM code AIMAll. An additional visualization
tool such as GaussView or Avogadro is also useful.

1. Geometry-optimize the molecular geometry of ethene and extract the optimized atomic coordinates as a .xyz-format file. Additionally, generate a WFX
   file for the optimized geometry.

2.  Once this has completed, and one has checked that the resulting structure is a local energy minimum (i.e. no imaginary frequencies 
    in the Gaussian output) one can either extract the optimized coordinates in .xyz format by loading the Gaussian output file into 
    either GaussView or Avogadro and exporting the final coordinates, or converting the WFX file back into .xyz form using the 
    QuantVec program:
        
        wfx_to_xyz ethane_opt.wfx ethane_opt.xyz

3.  Using the 'xyzalign' program within Quantvec to rotate the optimized molecule so as to 1) move the C1 atom to the coordinate origin, 2) Align the
    C1-C2 bond along the x-axis, then 3) additionally align the molecule so that it lies in the x-y plane.
   
        xyzalign ethane_opt.xyz ethane_opt_align.xyz 1 2 3

4. Run a constrained optimization, scanning the specified dihedral angle parameter, using the aligned geometry-optimized
   structure in ethane_opt_align.xyz as a starting point. Atom C1 is constrained to stay at the coordinate origin, the 
   length of the C1-C2 bond is constrained and the dihedral angle is scanned in steps of 1 degree, for 180 steps. The .log 
   file produced by G09 when the scan is completed contains the full details of the progress of the constrained optimization scan.
   
   Do two such constrained optimization scans: one where the angle step is +1.0 degrees, and another where the angle step is 
   -1.0 degrees.
   
        Example G09 input file: ethane_opt_align_angleplus.gjf (the angle step = +1.0 degrees case)

5. Extract a multi-step .xyz file containing the atomic coordinates at every step in the dihedral angle scan
   using the 'irc_to_xyz' QuantVec command:

        irc_to_xyz ethane_opt_align_angleplus.log ethane_opt_align_angleplus.xyz

   Make a new subdirectory 'singlepoints' and move the ethane_opt_align_angleplus.xyz and ethane_opt_align.xyz files there.
        mkdir singlepoints
        mv ethane_opt_a*.xyz singlepoints
        cd singlepoints
        
6. Convert every intermediate geometry held in the multi-step .xyz file into a single-point calculation of the
   wavefunction, saving the wavefunction details to a WFX-format output file. This can be most easily performed using
   the QuantVec command:
   
         xyz_to_gjf ethane_opt_align_angleplus.xyz singlepoint_template.txt
   
   This will generate G09 input files for every structure in the scan: these will be numbered 0001, 0002 etc.
   
   Also, generate a single point wavefunction calculation for the starting aligned structure
   xyz_to_gjf ethane_opt_align.xyz singlepoint_template.txt
   mv ethane_opt_align_0001.gjf ethane_opt_angleplus_0000.gjf
      
   Run all the newly-created .gjf Gaussian input files with G09

        for i in *.gjf; do g09 ${i} ; done
   
   Once all these .gjf files have been run with G09, each should have produced a corresponding .WFX file containing the
   single-point converged wavefunction.   
      
7. In the 'singlepoints' subdirectory, run AIMAll on each of the WFX files to generate one .sumviz file (each containing 
   molecular graph data) for each .WFX file.
   
        for i in *.wfx; do aimqb.ish ${i} --nproc=4 --skipint=true ; done
   
   The aimqb.ish command line parameters given above will speed up the calculations: --nproc sets the number of execution threads
   and --skipint=true avoids atomic integrations, which are not needed here.
   
The result will be a set of .sumviz files which is used as an input sequence of molecular graphs for construction of
an NG-QTAIM trajectory.
